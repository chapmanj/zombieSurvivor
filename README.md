# Zombie Survivor

## Motivation ðŸ¤“

This is an application of a knowledge-based agent in a modified version of the Hunt the Wumpus game. 
It was a project for the Artificial Intelligence course at Auburn University.
In the Artificial Intelligence field, this toy problem is called Wumpus World.

### Hunt the Wumpus
An emulation of the original Hunt The Wumpus game by Gregory Yob. It is included for the users reference. I did not develop this. Just unpack it to run it. (To get this file, select the "Education & Research" heading. Find the section titled "Artificial Intelligence".)
